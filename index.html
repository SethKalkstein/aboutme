				<h2 class="section-headings">In the Beginning</h2>
				<p class="section-text">I was born and raised in Philadelphia. I've been here my whole life, except for a year spent snowboarding the beautiful mountains of Colorado in the early 2000s. In my primary school years, I always loved math. I also excelled in Chemistry, but especially physics. My first exposure to programming computers was in summer camp in the mid 1980s, where one of the counselors showed us some BASIC on the camp's computer. My next exposure was in high school, when a math teacher taught us some PASAL during class. The BASIC didn't leave any impression on me, but I remember liking the small bit of PASCAL we looked at.</p>

				<h2 class="section-headings">Food</h2>
				<p class="section-text">
					Right out of high school I started was working in a combination deli/cheese-shop called Ardmore Cheese. During my 7 years there I gained lots of knowledge of cheese and customer service,  and ended up becoming the manager. My next five years were spent at Di Bruno Bros managing their cheese section. I found myself using spreadsheets extensively to make my job more efficient at Di Bruno Bros. I had scheduling spreadsheets that would calculate everything from the number of people working during lunch to employees hours.  I would also have spreadsheets that tracked spending, and sales that made use of calculations and were all littered with if/then statements. Other than spreadsheets, I would constantly look over sales datasets, and anylize the hundreds of items' margin, volume, etc... to make informed business decisions. I went on to consult in the gourmet food business for another 5 years. I helped set up new stores, expand existing ones, train management, set up operational guidelines, and most relevant to programming, continued to make ever more involved spreadsheets filled with crucial calculations.

				<h2 class="section-headings">Real Estate</h2>
				<p class="section-text">After well over a decade and a half in the food business, I moved on to Real Estate. Every generation of my family for as far back as we can trace (hundreds of years!) has been involved in building. I thought that I would give it a try too. I had been very interested in the rela estate market ever since buying my own home when I was only 25. But with my sales experience and tendancy to injure myself, I decided that being a realtor would be the most sensible choice for a job in the housing industry. As a realtor, I found myself pouring over sales data, getting immersed in the market trends and using computers a whole lot. I found that I could provide better pricing data than much more exerienced agents due to my ability to process and make sense of data on a computer. Showing houses is great and all, but it is the numbers involved, which always fascinated me most in the business. </p>

				<h2 class="section-headings">Coding</h2>
				<p class="section-text">  Which brings us to the thread that connects it all, computers. Throughout my life - even while selling delicious cheeses such as Cheddar, Gouda, and <i lang = "fr">Beaufort</i> - I always used computers. As a realtor I once again used computers, and most of all loved the fleeting moments where I got to use a conditional statement or two in a spreadsheet. When consulting and managing and managing in the gourmet food world, it was the would make scheduling spreadsheets that automatically calcualted shifts covered, hours, conversions, and other financial statistics that I mentioned above. In Real Estate, I would use string manipulation to appropriately format multiple letters to other realtors to reflect data appropriate to their buyers, or to sort through and calculate new data to base pricing off of. About a decade ago, when I was in the food business, I had even taken a class at Community College in Java for fun, and really liked it. At one point I taught myself some html and css to write a dinky little cheese related website for fun. At work, when I was writing the word "if" in a spreadsheet was the only times I would truly be in the zone and I was coding for fun, too. After thinking long and hard about it, I knew that I could not ignore the urge to program any longer,  I must immerse myself in code.</p>
