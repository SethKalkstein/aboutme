				<h2 class="section-headings">In the Beginning</h2>
				<p class="section-text">I was born and raised in Philadelphia. I've been here my whole life, except for a bunch of months spent snowboarding the beautiful mountains of Colorado in the early 2000s. In my primary school years, I always loved math. (and still do) I excelled in the sciences, especially physics. My first exposure to programming computers was in summer camp in the mid 1980s. One of the counselors showed us some BASIC on the camp's computer. My next exposure was in high school, when a math teacher taught us some PASCAL during class. The BASIC didn't leave any impression on me, but I remember liking the small bit of PASCAL we looked at.</p>

				<h2 class="section-headings">Food</h2>
				<p class="section-text">
					Right out of high school I started working in a combination deli/cheese-shop called Ardmore Cheese and Graummann's Deli. During my 7 years there I gained lots of knowledge about cheese and customer service. I ended up becoming the manager. My next five years were spent at Di Bruno Bros managing their cheese section. I found myself using spreadsheets extensively to make my job more efficient at Di Bruno Bros. I had scheduling spreadsheets that would calculate everything from the number of people working during lunch to employees hours.  I would also have spreadsheets that tracked spending and sales. The spreadsheets made use of calculations, and were all littered with if/then statements. Other than spreadsheets, I would constantly look over sales datasets, and anylize the hundreds of items' margins, sales volume, etc... to make informed business decisions. I went on to consult in the gourmet food business for another 7 years. I helped set up new stores, expand existing ones, train management, set up operational guidelines, and most relevant to programming, continued to make ever more involved spreadsheets filled with crucial calculations.

				<h2 class="section-headings">Real Estate</h2>
				<p class="section-text">After well over a decade and a half in the food business, I moved on to Real Estate. Every generation of my family for as far back as we can trace (hundreds of years!) has been involved in building. I thought that I would give it a try too. I had been very interested in the real estate market ever since buying my own home when I was 25. With my sales experience and tendancy to injure myself, I decided that being a realtor would be the most sensible choice for a job in the housing industry. As a realtor, I found myself pouring over sales data, getting immersed in the market trends and using computers a whole lot. I found that I could provide better pricing data than much more exerienced agents due to my ability to process and make sense of data on a computer. I still used spreadsheets for calculations, sorting and cleaning email lists, all while sneaking in conditionals whenever they could improve data or would save me repition down the road. Showing houses was great and all, but it was the numbers involved which always fascinated me most in the business. </p>

				<h2 class="section-headings">Coding</h2>
				<p class="section-text">  Which brings us to the thread that connects it all, computers. Throughout my life - even while selling delicious cheeses such as Cheddar, Gouda, and <i lang = "fr">Beaufort</i> - I always used computers. As a realtor I once again used computers, and most of all loved the fleeting moments where I got to use a conditional statement or two in a spreadsheet. When consulting and managing in the gourmet food world, those moments came when writing scheduling spreadsheets that automatically calculated shifts covered, hours, conversions, or other financial statistics spreadsheets that I mentioned above. In Real Estate, I would use string manipulation to appropriately format multiple letters to other realtors to reflect data appropriate to their buyers, or to sort through and calculate new data to base pricing off of. About a decade ago when I was in the food business, I took a class at Community College in Java, just for fun! I really liked that class and it left a strong impression in the back of my mind. At one point I taught myself some html and css to write a dinky little cheese related website for fun. At one point I got sick and tired of rewriting the side bar that listed the cheeses every time I added a new one. So I learned a little bit of PHP, automating the sidebar to update when I added a new cheese. At work, the times when I was writing the word "if" in a spreadsheet were the times I would truly be in the zone and I was coding for fun, too. After thinking long and hard about it, I knew that I could not ignore the urge to program any longer,  I must immerse myself in code.</p>

				<h2 class="section-headings">Other Interests</h2>
				<p class="section-text">Since childhood, I've loved skiing. These days I also love getting to the mountains (or just the Wissahickon) to hike when the oportunity arises. When I can, I use my bike for trasportation around the city, but also like going on joy rides. I also like yoga, and have started meditating over the last few years. I play an African hand drum called a djembe and the guitar. I listen mostly to Rock and Roll music, but also some folk, jazz, techo and classical. My favorite TV shows are the Star Trek series. I also like Better Call Saul, Discovery Channel, History Channel, Seinfeld, The Orville, and Futurama. I like cats, expecially my 2 awesome cats. (the gitHub cat is pretty cool looking, too.)
